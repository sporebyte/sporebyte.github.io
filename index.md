<p style="text-align: center;">I'm a bioinformatics graduate student fascinated by the physical principles underlying biological systems. My interests include data visualization, biophysical modeling, image processing and computational simulations of living systems. With a background in microbiology and genetics, I enjoy bridging experimental data with computational approaches.</p>
